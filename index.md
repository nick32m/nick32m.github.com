          Hi I am Nick Luo, I am a passionate software engineer/developer currently residing in Brisbane, Australia. In my current work, I am specialised in developing secure web applications ,iPhone/iPad applications development. I also have great interests on the following areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <p> Algorithms designed and implementation </p> </li>
          <li> <p>Scaling web applications (Although I don't have experience on it) </p></li>
          <li> <p> Solve chanllenging problems</p> </li>
        </ul>

        <p> 
          I am also a great fan of Apple. I use iMac at work and Macbook Pro at home. I use sublime text on programming. I have a great exposure to Apple's Cocoa Framework and really like the design patterns and the extra (NS) libraries it has added to Objective-C language , makes a very enjoyable experience to program on iOS/OSX platform.
        </p>

        <p> 
          I am also a big fan of open source software. In my own time, I love exposuring Github and see what has been happening in the open source community.

Complete usage and documentation available at: [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com)

## Update Author Attributes

In `_config.yml` remember to specify your own data:
    
    title : My Blog =)
    author :
      name : Name Lastname
      email : blah@email.test
      github : username
      twitter : username

The theme should reference these variables whenever needed.
    
## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples. -->
